# Profile and competences

Since 1998 I have been working as a freelance on the design and development of enterprise software solutions for international organizations.

I am a musician – I have released 4 albums in my career so far – and an avid science fiction and horror reader – in these very genres I regularly publish stories on my blog.

Over the years I have been leading teams of 15-20 members including firmware engineers, software engineers, data scientists, and project managers.

I am a big fan of agile project management, SCRUM in particular, as well as continuous integration and continuous delivery.

I have developed strong communication and presentation skills working as a technical author, speaker, and trainer.

I have specialized in data science, big data analytics, machine learning, and simulation.

Since 2014 I have been working as Software & Data Science Director for Delcon Italy and Delcon USA, two twin companies manufacturing medical devices for blood banking.

Thanks to my collaboration with Delcon, I have become an expert in the development of software medical devices in compliance with IEC 62304, ISO 13485, and FDA regulations.
