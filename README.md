# About me

I have been designing and developing enterprise software solutions since 1998, mostly through freelance and entrepreneurial roles, for a variety of international organizations. My work has spanned software architecture, full-stack development, and machine learning, often in regulated environments like medical devices.

I have led teams of up to 20 people, always with a servant leadership approach, focused on enabling others to thrive and deliver their best work. I have also contributed to cultural and technical assessments as part of the recruiting process.

I have been active for many years as a speaker, conference presenter, classroom and e-learning instructor, and author—opportunities that have developed my communication skills and allowed me to give back to the tech community.

I am a [musician](https://nothence.com) with four released albums, and a long-time reader and [writer](https://fabioscagliola.com/blog) of science fiction.

I am bilingual in English and Italian, and also speak French, German, and Spanish.
